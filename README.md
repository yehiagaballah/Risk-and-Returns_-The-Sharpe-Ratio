# Risk-and-Returns_-The-Sharpe-Ratio

Hey There, 

This project is a part of a series of projects on [Datacamp.com](https://learn.datacamp.com/) for Data Science with Python [Career Track](https://learn.datacamp.com/career-tracks/data-scientist-with-python?version=5)

It is a guided project offering the datasets and what kind of analysis is needed with them while allowing you to perform the code that executes these functions.

In the End, it offers a series of tests to make sure the output the code generates matches what is expected of the output.

This code tests a dataset of the data produced for stocks prices across different kinds of analysis and offers a comparisson between Amazon and Facebook stocks to offer a recommendation for which stocks to buy

The analysis follows the [Sharpe Ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharpe_ratio) to determine the better share to buy between the 2
